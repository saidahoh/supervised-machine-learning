Considering the Models -

Once I reviewed the data and the model types, I believe that the regression model
will perform better for this dataset.  
Evaluating the Models - without scaling the data, the Random Forest model performed better on the test data.  

Results w/ Scaling - Once I scaled the data, the logistic regression became the better classifier. It had an accuracy score of .66.  
The Random Forest model decreased in accuracy from 0.64 to 0.5.  

While I was able to produce a model with a .66 accuracy metric, I donâ€™t think that is accurate enough to use in determining credit worthiness.
